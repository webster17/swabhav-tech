<li> AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.</li>
<li> AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.</li>
<li> Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.</li>
<li> Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests.</li>
<li> With AJAX, when you hit submit, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results, and update the current screen.</li>
<li> In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.</li>
<li> AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.</li>
<li> A user can continue to use the application while the client program requests information from the server in the background.</li>
<li> Intuitive and natural user interaction. Clicking is not required, mouse movement is a sufficient event trigger.</li>
<li> Data-driven as opposed to page-driven.</li>
<li> AJAX is the most viable Rich Internet Application (RIA) technology so far.</li>
