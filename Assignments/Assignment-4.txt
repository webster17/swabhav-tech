1.	Understan Interface.
		- An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
		- The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the java interface not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
		- Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.
		- It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.

		Why use Java interface?
		There are mainly three reasons to use interface. They are given below.
		- It is used to achieve abstraction.
		- By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
		- It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

		Note:
		- The java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method. 
		- It adds public, static and final keywords before data members.
